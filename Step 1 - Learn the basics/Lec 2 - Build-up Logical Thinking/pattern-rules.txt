To solve any pattern based question, follow 4 rules:

Generally, the outer loop is for the rows and the inner loop is for columns

1. For the outer loop, count the number of lines
2. For the inner loop, focus on the number of columns and connect them somehow to the rows
3. Whatever you are printing, do it in the inner for loop
4. Observe symmetry (only applicable to certain patterns)
